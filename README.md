# Swiftduino

This repository is a Maker's Arduino palette with examples for fast developing.

The purpose of this repo is sharing the modular code I have written in my Arduino projects.

[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is a great development platform for fast prototyping and integration with many different SoCs and microconotrollers. I guess it does not require much presentation.

I hope you find this project interesting. Please, do not hesitate in propose improvements and corrections. Everyone is welcomed.
